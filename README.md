# Devathon Project
This is the base layout for your Devathon Project. It includes several scripts to make running incredibly easy on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## ** INSTRUCTIONS **

1. When you have the plugin installed and loaded on a server, run the command /terminal.
This should show you all valid commands, and you can play around with them if you desire.

2. You'll want to run the command /terminal setpassword <password> - this will set your "terminal password,"
which will allow you to login to the terminal machine and run certain Minecraft commands! :)

[OPTIONAL] User data is stored in the userData.yml - you could edit from there if you'd like, and then type
/terminal reload to reload that data file.

[OPTIONAL] You may also set your username, the same way as above, or using /terminal setusername <username> -
by default your username for the terminal will be your in-game name. (IGN)

3. Once you have your password set, type /terminal give <your in-game name> - this will give you a terminal block,
ready to be placed down.

[NOTE] This system works, but it's a bit buggy and throws some errors in console. I would've liked to fix this and gone
into more detail and make it have more features, but I don't have much time left - I'll try to get it done if I can. (6:12 AM Mountain Time)

4. When the terminal is placed, it will prompt you to enter your username & password - you may do so. Enter it in chat.
If you haven't set a password, it will send you an error message telling you that you need to set a password.

[NOTE] When entering your password, "Invalid Password" might show up, just ignore it if you've set a password.

[NOTE] This plugin is chat-based. Besides commands, everything is done in chat.

5. Great! You're signed in. If not, refer to earlier steps (and feel free to ask me on Discord!- if that's allowed)
It should send you
"Signed into <your username>"
"Type 'help' to view all commands. Type 'exit' to exit the terminal."

Type "help" in chat to view all commands. Type any of those commands in chat, and it will make you run the command-
If you don't have permission to do /stop, for example, you won't be able to do it via Terminal.

You can also type exit which will simply leave the terminal, sign out, and keep the block there. You'll have to give yourself
another block if you want to sign in again. (Sorry, ran out of time. I wanted the block to destroy on exit)


That's pretty much it! I'll add anything if I remember.

Huge thanks to @codenameflip, who helped me switch to IntelliJ *temporarily* and help me fix Maven countless times so I could code my idea.
It took like 2 hours, and if he didn't help me, I wouldn't have been able to do this.

NOTE - He did not break the rules in any way, he simply helped me get going.

Thanks for taking your time to read & review my project.

P.S.
By the way, https://github.com/JoinDevathon/Athena222-2016 is me - I don't know why it created two - I think I
changed my name in that time period. Of course, my project is in this repository, AthenaDev.
Do not view that one, because it has nothing and i've requested for it to be deleted.

## Get Started

**If you already know how to use Maven, then more than likely the following steps are irrelevant for you. Just do your usual thing.**

---

Don't worry, we made a video! Check it out at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5HXS0l-VwQ

---

First things first, you need to have the Java JDK8 installed. You can find the appropriate version here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Then you need to have git installed. You can find the appropriate version for your OS here: https://git-scm.com/

There are no other required dependencies, however Maven is optional if you want to set up your own development environment outside of what we do for you.

## Running

If you're on Windows, you'll want to run all of these commands inside Git Bash, which is a program installed when you installed Git. You can paste by right clicking inside of the window.

If you don't have this Git repository cloned yet, click on clone or download. If you have an SSH key on your account, use the SSH link. Otherwise use the HTTPS link if you want to use your GitHub username and password.

Then run

```bash
git clone <link>
```

To run your server, do:

```bash
./run-server.sh
```

On first run this will download and compile the Spigot version that you're using for the contest. Because you're using this exact version of Spigot for the entire contest, you can safely use CraftBukkit and Minecraft Server code.

This wrapper around the Spigot server has a few extra features that are not included inside of regular Spigot. If you type `stop` to stop the Minecraft Server, it'll automatically recompile your code and restart the server. To fully stop the server, type `exit` to safely stop the server and exit the recompilation loop. If you're on Windows, you won't have a `exit` command and will instead be asked every loop if you want to recompile.
